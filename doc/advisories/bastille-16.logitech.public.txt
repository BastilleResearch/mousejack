Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 16
Document version: 1.0

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that allows an attacker to wirelessly configure a Logitech G900
mouse to inject a keystroke macro whenever the user clicks a specified mouse button. 



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Logitech G900
- Logitech G900 dongle C-U0008 (USB ID 046d:c539)



Impact

Using the Logitech Gaming Software, a user can customize their G900 mouse to trigger keystroke macros
whenever they click a specified mouse button. The macros are stored on the mouse itself, and do not
depend on any software being installed on the host computer. The G900 dongle communicates with the 
G900 mouse by attaching payloads to ACK packets going from the dongle back to the mouse. 

The communication between the mouse and dongle is unencrypted, making it possible for an attacker to 
program arbitrary macros into the mouse. 



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Logitech G900 mouse, which requires 
physical proximity to the target mouse.



Suggested Solutions

The transceivers used in the G900 USB dongle and mouse support 128-bit AES encryption. Updating
the firmware on the dongle and mouse to enable encryption would mitigate this vulnerability. 



Test Environment

Keystroke injection was tested using a nRF24LU1+ based USB dongle, transmitting to a G900 mouse.
