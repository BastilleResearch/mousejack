Overview

The Dell KM714 wireless keyboard remains vulnerable to a previously reported unencrypted keystroke
injection vulnerability after all available patches have been applied. 



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Dell KM714 wireless keyboard
- Dell KM714 USB Dongle C-U0007
  - Firmware version 012.005.00028
  - USB ID 046d:c52b



Impact

The updates made available by Dell for the KM714 wireless keyboard and mouse set do not work to update
the firmware on the USB dongle, keyboard, or mouse. 

1. Dell Universal Receiver Control Panel

http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/dell-wir-kybrd-mouse-km714/drivers

The software installs without error, but the user interface displays a message "Please plug in a Dell 
Universal Receiver to get started," and does not appear to recognize the Dell KM714 USB dongle. 

2. KM714 & WM514 Dell Universal Receiver Update

http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=7N2F0

The "Dell FW Upgrade Tool" installation fails with the error message "A compatible device is not 
detected."

3. Dell Unifying Application

http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=9PPPW

This installs the Logitech Unifying software, which does not contain a firmware update for the Dell 
KM714 set. 

4. Logitech Firmware

The Dell KM714 USB dongle is identical to the USB dongles bundled with Logitech Unifying keyboards 
and mice. Installing the Logitech provided firmware on a Dell KM714 USB dongle fails to mitigate 
unencrypted keystroke injection attacks on several computer configurations. 

On a computer with a clean install of Windows 10, a USB dongle with the latest firmware does not 
accept unencrypted keystrokes. However, there are several situations in which keystroke injection still 
works. 

A. When Logitech SetPoint is installed on Windows, keystroke injection starts working again. Tested on 
Windows 10.

B. Keystroke injection works on Linux. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 15.04, and Ubuntu 16.04. 

C. Keystroke injection works on OSX. Tested on OSX Yosemite. 



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Dell KM714 USB dongle, which 
requires physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

Update the USB dongle firmware to prevent unencrypted keystrokes from being sent to the host computer.



Test Environment

Keystroke injection was tested using a nRF24LU1+ based USB dongle, transmitting to a Dell KM714 USB dongle.
