Overview

In order to address a previously reported unencrypted keystroke injection vulnerability, Logitech 
released updated firmware for the C-U0007 and C-U0008 Unifying USB dongles. The firmware updates fail
to mitigate unencrypted keystroke injection attacks on several computer configurations. 



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Logitech K400r

- Logitech Unifying Dongle C-U0007
  - Firmware version 012.005.00028
  - USB ID 046d:c52b

- Logitech Unifying Dongle C-U0008
  - Firmware version 024.003.00027
  - USB ID 046d:c52b  



Impact

On a computer with a clean install of Windows 10, a Unifying dongle with the latest firmware does not 
accept unencrypted keystrokes. However, there are several situations in which keystroke injection still 
works:

1. When Logitech SetPoint is installed on Windows, keystroke injection starts working again. Tested on 
Windows 10.

2. Keystroke injection works on Linux. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 15.04, and Ubuntu 16.04. 

3. Keystroke injection works on OS X. Tested on OS X Yosemite. 



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Logitech Unifying dongle, which 
requires physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

Update the USB dongle firmware to prevent unencrypted keystrokes from being sent to the host computer.



Test Environment

Keystroke injection was tested using a nRF24LU1+ based USB dongle, transmitting to affected Unifying 
dongles.
